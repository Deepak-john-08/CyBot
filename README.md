# 🤖 CyBot – AI-Powered Cybersecurity Assistant

CyBot is an AI-driven cybersecurity assistant that helps users detect phishing emails and malicious URLs in real time. Think of it as your personal cybersecurity analyst that talks to you like a human and protects you like a firewall.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

CyBot empowers users to identify phishing threats through an interactive chat interface. Built with a hybrid detection engine using BERT and rule-based analysis, it delivers instant, intelligent security advice within a clean and responsive UI.

## 🧠 AI Detection Engine

### 🚀 Hybrid Detection Approach

1. **BERT Model** (Stored in `bert_phishing_model_tf/`)
   - Deep learning model trained on phishing data.
   - Detects complex, deceptive language patterns.

2. **Rule-Based Detection**
   - Pattern matching and keyword flags.
   - Fast and reliable for known threats.

### 🔁 Detection Logic

```python
def analyze_content(user_input):
    ai_result = bert_model.predict(user_input)
    if ai_result:
        return ai_result
    return rule_based_detection(user_input)
```

## 🧪 Detection Examples

### 📨 Email Phishing Example

**Input:**
```
Subject: Urgent: Payment Request  
Hi, please transfer $8,500 urgently. I'm unavailable now. — [CEO]
```

**Detected as:** `Phishing`  
**Response:**  
> 🚨 Whoa, hold up! This email has red flags all over — classic phishing move!

---

### 🌐 URL Phishing Example

**Input:**
```
https://paypal.secure-user-login.net
```

**Detected as:** `Phishing`  
**Response:**  
> 🚨 Yikes! This link screams danger. It’s a phishing trap. Stay away!
